# Responsive_PortfolioHW2
Upon creating this website about me, I had never made a website compatable with mobile. After this project that changed. Along with learning basic usages of components from bootstrap; I also learned a great deal about making a web page responsive on not only a computer, but also a mobile device. From watching hours of videos to just playing with widths and heights of pictures, I was finally able to make my webpage not only responsive for mobile devices, but also look relatively decent! The hardest part of this project was definitely taking a lot of time into learning basic javascript so my naviagtion bar at the top would work on a mobile device. Apart from that, my pictures were constantly straying off the screen of my cell phone, so I was constantly playing with the heights and widths to ensure my pictures were staying on the screen of the phone! 
Although I encountered many problems along the way, I couldnt have learned more from a single project! In the future of making a web page compatable with mobile devices I will have a much better understanding for the resources I will need in order to overcome issues I may encounter in the future!
